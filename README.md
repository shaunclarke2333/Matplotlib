# Using Matplotlib to visulaize how 4 trial drugs compared across 250 subjects

In this study, 250 mice were treated through a variety of drug regimes over the course of 45 days. Their physiological responses were then monitored over the course of that time. I will attempt to analyze the data to show how four treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo) compare.
